        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>We may update these Terms of Service in the future.</p>
        <p>
          When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to
          the latest Terms of Service. That's true for any of our existing and
          future products and all features that we add to our Services over
          time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right
          or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving
          that right or provision. These terms do contain a limitation of our
          liability.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That's
          a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us.
        </p>
        <p>
          By accessing and using tryrewrite.com (the Service) and any other
          site, application, API or embedded content owned or operated by us,
          you accept and agree to be bound by the following terms and
          conditions:
        </p>
        <h2>Account Terms</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and
            password. The Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or
            damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
          </li>
          <li>
            You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our Use
            Restrictions policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs
            under your account. That includes content posted by others who
            either: (a) have access to your login credentials; or (b) have their
            own logins under your account.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Payment, Refunds, and Plan Changes</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If you are using a free version of one of our Services, it is really
            free: we do not ask you for your credit card and — just like for
            customers who pay for our Services — we do not sell your data.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are upgrading from a free plan to a paid plan, we will charge
            your card immediately and your billing cycle starts on the day of
            upgrade. For other upgrades or downgrades in plan level, the new
            rate starts from the next billing cycle.
          </li>
          <li>
            We issue refunds for digital products within 14 days of the original
            purchase of the product.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Cancellation and Termination</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            All of your content will be inaccessible from the Services
            immediately upon account cancellation. Within 30 days, all content
            will be permanently deleted from active systems and logs. Within 60
            days, all content will be permanently deleted from our backups. We
            cannot recover this information once it has been permanently
            deleted.
          </li>
          <li>
            We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse
            any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at
            any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account
            will not be able to access the account or any content in the
            account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your
            account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and
            relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the
            right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at
            any time. We have this clause because statistically speaking, out of
            the hundreds of thousands of accounts on our Services, there is at
            least one doing something nefarious. There are some things we
            staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise that
            stance. For more details, see our Use Restrictions policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse
            or retribution) of Company employee or officer will result in
            immediate account termination.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Uptime, Security, and Privacy</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these
            Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis.{' '}
          </li>
          <li>
            We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your
            usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of
            the Services. Of course, we'll reach out to the account owner before
            taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may
            negatively impact the performance of the Service for other
            customers.
          </li>
          <li>
            We take many measures to protect and secure your data through
            backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for
            data transmission from the public Internet.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take
            that trust to heart. You agree that Basecamp may process your data
            as described in our Privacy Policy and for no other purpose.
          </li>
          <li>
            We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the
            necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related
            technology required to run the Services.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Copyright and Content Ownership</h2>
        <p>
          You agree that we own all of the intellectual property rights in the
          Service. You grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable,
          perpetual and sub-licensable right to use, reproduce, distribute and
          display (including for commercial purposes) on the Service and in
          other media any content or material that you post on the Service, and
          any name(s) and/or avatar under which you post such content. Other
          than this right, we claim no intellectual property rights in relation
          to the information or content that you upload onto the Service.
